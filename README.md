This project based on The Odin Project curriculum section "Javascript: How to organize your code (design pattern)"

Goals:
- Use global variables as minimum as possible.
- Use Function Factories for creation of multiple things (e.g. Player Object).
- Use Modules for single thing such as GameBoard, DisplayController, etc.
- Add computer as opponent.

Future update:
- Add smart computer (unbeatable AI as opponent) => future updates :p
